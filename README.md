# Analysis of fertilizers and products

Fertilizers are used daily by farmers and families to help crops and gardens grow. Whether for a small garden of flowers and plants, or a large farm with thousands of acres of crops, a wide range of fertilizers have been developed to help different crops grow in different soil and weather conditions.

Chemical ingredients help create fertilizers that promote plant growth and are cost effective, too. Commercial and consumer fertilizers are strictly regulated by both individual states and the federal government to ensure that they are safe for the people who use them, people nearby, and the surrounding environment.

So how is fertilizer being used in your country?
What is the most used fertilizer in your country over the years?
What is the most produced in your country and how is the export?
What is the best and worst rate of import and export (that is, ratio of imported and exported product) in your country over the years?

Here try to answer some of these questions, analysing the fertilizers in Brazil.
